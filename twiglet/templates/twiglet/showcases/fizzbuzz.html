  This is Mike Minutillo's Enterprise worthy implementation of the infamous <a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">Fizzbuzz programming challenge</a>. Mike has blogged about <a href="http://codermike.com/if-something-is-worth-doing">his motivation</a> and provided <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fizzbuzz/">the source code</a>. It provides a nice, well-written C# program to show off some of CS2J's goodies. The translation from C# to Java shown here is compeletely automatic:
<p>
<ul>
   <li>

     As is required for Java programs,  classes are placed in their own file, in directories named after
     their package. Packages are named after the namespaces used in the C# program. Minimal, sufficient import
     statements are automatically inserted into each class definition.

   </li>
   <li>

      All comments are transferred from the C# program into the Java
      code.  In addition, C# documentation comments are translated
      into Javadoc comments.  You can compare
      the <a href="/static/twiglet/showcasedoc/net/fizzbuzz/Index.html">C#
      documentation</a> to
      the <a href="/static/twiglet/showcasedoc/java/fizzbuzz/index.html">Java
      documentation</a>.

   </li>

   <li>

     CS2J uses flexible XML translation templates to guide its translation of external calls. The provided translations for 
     the <code class="prettyprint">System.Int32</code> class guide the translation of 
     <code class="prettyprint">number.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)</code> (IdentityTransformer.cs, line 34) to
     <code class="prettyprint">NumberFormat.getInstance(LocaleSupport.INVARIANT).format(number)</code> 
     (IdentityTransformer.java, line 35) and make sure the correct imports are added to the Java class.

   </li>
   <li>

      Getter and Setter methods are automatically created for C# properties.  References
      to properties are automatically converted to the appropriate setter/getter call.
      See the translation for the Message property and its usage from StaticMessageTransformer.cs in
      StaticMessageTransformer.java.

   </li>
   <li>

     Delegates are fully supported.  In <code class="prettyprint">FizzBuzz.BusinessLogic.FizzBuzzLogic.java</code> 
     (line 56) a delegate creation expression has been transformed 
     to the creation of an anonymous object that supports the <code class="prettyprint">Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;
     </code> interface (most importantly it has an <code class="prettyprint">invoke()</code> method that will
     run the delegate code). More examples of delegate and event handling can be seen in the Delegates show case.

   </li>
   <li>

      CS2J automatically adds the necessary methods to classes that implement the C# <code class="prettyprint">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> 
      and <code class="prettyprint">ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code> interfaces so that they also support the corresponding
      Java Iterable and Collection classes. An example of this is in <code class="prettyprint">FizzBuzz.Core.Range.java</code>
      where an <code class="prettyprint">iterator()</code> has been added. Another example is shown in the Generics show case.

   </li>

</ul>  

     There are many more interesting examples that you can find by studying this example. You can download the code
     by right clicking on the top most folder. Both are runnable code.  For the Java code you will also need the
     CS2JLibrary project which you can download as part of the 
     <a href="{% url webapp.views.download %}">CS2J trial</a>..
