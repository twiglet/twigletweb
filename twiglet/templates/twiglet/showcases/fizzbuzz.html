  This is Mike Minutillo's Enterprise worthy implementation of the infamous <a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">Fizzbuzz programming challenge</a>. Mike has blogged about <a href="http://codermike.com/if-something-is-worth-doing">his motivation</a> and provided <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fizzbuzz/">the source code</a>. It provides a nice, well-written C# program to show off some of CS2J's goodies. The translation from C# to Java shown here is compeletely automatic:
<ul>
   <li>CS2J transfers comments from the C# program into the Java code.  In addition, C# documentation comments are translated into Javadoc comments.  You can compare the <a href="/static/twiglet/showcasedoc/net/fizzbuzz/Index.html">C# documentation</a> to the <a href="/static/twiglet/showcasedoc/java/fizzbuzz/index.html">Java documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
