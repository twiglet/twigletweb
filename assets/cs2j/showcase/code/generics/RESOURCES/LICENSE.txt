The sample programs shown here were developed by me while visiting Microsoft Research, Cambridge UK in October-December 2001.

These programs are made available here in the hope that they will be interesting to look at, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. They are presented here solely to indicate some programming styles and potential uses of generics in C#. In particular, nobody assumes any responsibility for any legal or real consequences of using these sample programs.
